Medical Insurance Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on key factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. Using machine learning, specifically the Random Forest Regressor, the model analyzes historical data to provide accurate cost estimates.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
